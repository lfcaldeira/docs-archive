<!--Concepts provide context for task and reference topics. -->

## <# TITLE -- Insert a noun or verb phrase that describes the main questions answered by the topic, like “Managing code with a control repository” or “What gets installed where”. #>

<# SHORTDESC -- Insert a 1-2 sentence description of the topic’s theme, aka its thesis statement. #>

<# PARAGRAPH -- Insert one or more paragraphs that elaborate on the topic’s theme. #>

<# NOTE (optional) -- Use notes to call attention to important information. Notes are preceded with a note, caution, tip, important, remember, or restriction label. For example, "**Note:** PE doesn't support adding additional MCollective user accounts." #>

<# UNORDERED LIST (optional) -- Use bulleted lists to itemize information that has no specific order, like major benefits of the software. Don’t use ordered lists to jam reference information into concepts. If list items include more than one piece of information, create a reference topic. #>

<# ORDERED LIST (optional) -- Use numbered lists to describe processes or other information that occurs in a specific order. Don’t use ordered lists to jam task information into concepts. If the list describes a process the user must perform, create a task topic. #>

<# FIGURE (optional) -- Use illustrations, diagrams, or other graphics to visualize conceptual information. #>

### <# SECTION (optional) -- Use subheads to break concepts into logical sections, rather than creating a separate topic, when you: a) expect users to view the information together, or b) the information doesn't make sense on its own. Sections must have a title and may contain paragraphs, notes, lists, or figures. #>
